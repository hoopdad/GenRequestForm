    <h2>An Example</h2>
    <p>
            Have the system write an article with the Title of "Pros and Cons of AI for the American Workforce" 
                as perceived by "A Cambridge-educated European Economist who loves to visit New York City especially for the cheesecake". 
            You will get output such as the following, which can then be validated by you and published by you. The content will already be marked up for HTML, the language that web browsers use to format pages.
